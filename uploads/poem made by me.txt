Abridge my soul, set it abaft.
Bring me an abbot and abbess, to abandon my past.
Attune my aberrations,
Till then, put it all in abeyance.
Snout bigger than an aardvark.
The afflictions of a past full of lies.
Adrift in an ocean, waves of annoyance.
Aroused by assurances, alms-seekers all around me.
Alerted by anything, a sack full of anxieties.
Another day gone, another opportunity gone.
